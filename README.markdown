# MANDY :rocket: :pill: :fire:

***A hypersonic static-site generator written in Rust. :rocket: :pill: :fire:***

## ABOUT :books:

Roughly one year ago, when I was just starting to learn Rust, I was re-building my main website and wondered which static-site generator to use for this re-building project. I had been using Jekyll up until that point but then heard rumours that Ruby (the language that Jekyll was written in) was declining very quickly in use and decided to write my own static-site generator in Rust. This project was called ***Acid***. I used ***Acid*** for some time but then got bored and deleted it because there were too many problems with ***Acid***. Recently, I got interested again in writing my own static-site generator after contributing a lot to the [Lume project](https://lume.land), a static-site generator based on the [Deno](https://deno.land) Javascript runtime. Since I now know much more about coding in Rust, I decided to revive ***Acid*** and make a new project based on ***Acid***, called ***Mandy***. This is that project. In case you do not know what a static-site generator is, here's a link that explains everything: [Read Me](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/static-site-generator/). This repository contains the source code for ***Mandy***. I have big plans for her. :heart_on_fire:

## INSTALLATION :inbox_tray:

I'm still testing ***Mandy*** and completing the other items on the to-do list, so I haven't figured out the conventional ways of packaging yet. To install ***Mandy*** for now, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.org) and [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed. Once you have both installed, run this command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/angeldollface/mandy
```
